### BDD
1. The behaviour of the correct syntax to print a page using JavaScript? is window.print(); browser.print(); navigator.print(); document.print(); 
 Therefore, output example is: The value[1,2,3,4] is (1) window.prit ()
2.  The behaviour of Which built-in method calls a function for each element in the array? is while();loop(); ;None of the above; 
 Therefore, output example is: The value[1,2,3,4] is (1) forEach()
